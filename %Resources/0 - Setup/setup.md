After the input action is created, bind a key to it by pressing the plus icon and either pressing the key you want on your keyboard or searching for it in the menu.

You can add as many keybinds to an action as you want, and multiple different actions can share keybinds. This input action can be refrenced in code by the name you set at the start.
